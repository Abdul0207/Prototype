                <img src="https://pragativadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/images-46.jpeg" alt="Diwali Celebrations"
                    style="width: 100%">
                <p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated by millions of people around the globe,
                    especially those of Hindu, Jain, and Sikh faiths. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness,
                    good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. During Diwali, homes are decorated with lights and
                    candles, and families gather to pray, feast, and exchange gifts. Fireworks are also a common part of
                    the celebrations. Diwali fosters unity and joy among communities, promoting cultural diversity and
                    harmony.</p>

                    <p><strong>Emily Watson:</strong> Diwali is such a beautiful celebration! While it's not a tradition
                        native to Britain, it's wonderful to see the vibrant colors, lights, and joy it brings to
                        communities here. It's a reminder of the diversity and richness of cultures around the world,
                        and it's heartwarming to join in the festivities and learn more about Hindu traditions.</p>

                <img src="https://recipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/8-things-to-know-about-chinese-new-year-1695727261.jpeg"
                    alt="Chinese New Year Celebrations" style="width: 100%">
                <p>Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is one of the most important celebrations in
                    Chinese culture. It marks the beginning of the lunar new year and is celebrated with family
                    reunions, feasting, and various cultural activities. Traditional customs include lion and dragon
                    dances, firecrackers, and the giving of red envelopes containing money. The festival represents a
                    time of renewal, reflection, and hope for prosperity in the coming year. Chinese New Year
                    celebrations are not only limited to China but are also observed by Chinese communities worldwide.

                <p><strong>Michael Thompson:</strong> The Chinese New Year is such an exciting time! Although it's not a
                    tradition we grew up with, the energy and festivities surrounding it are infectious. I love seeing
                    the dragon dances, fireworks, and sharing in the delicious food. It's a testament to the cultural
                    diversity we have in our community, and it's fantastic to learn about and celebrate traditions from
                    around the world.</p>
